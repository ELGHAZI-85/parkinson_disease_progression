# Kaggle Competition : AMPÂ®-Parkinson's Disease Progression Prediction

# parkinson_disease_progression
Parkinson's disease is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects the central nervous system. It is caused by the loss of dopamine-producing cells in the brain, resulting in a variety of motor and non-motor symptoms.

# Our role: 
Our goal is to predict the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores for patient visit and for any potential visits 6, 12, and 24 months later. 
The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is a widely used assessment tool by healthcare providers and researchers to evaluate the severity of symptoms and monitor their progression over time in Parkinson's disease.
